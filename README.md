# Chatbot-using-Python
Build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.
